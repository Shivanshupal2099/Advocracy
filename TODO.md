# TODO - Fix Homelayout Issue

## Completed Tasks âœ…
- [x] Fixed Home component to use Layout instead of Homelayout directly
- [x] Updated routing structure to properly support home page layout
- [x] Ensured consistent layout structure between App.jsx and Home component

## Changes Made:
- **src/pages/home.jsx**: Changed from using `Homelayout` directly to using the same `Layout` component structure as defined in `App.jsx`
- This resolves the routing mismatch where `Homelayout` was nested under `/home/homelayout` but the `Home` component was trying to use it directly

## Next Steps:
- Test the home page to ensure it renders correctly
- Verify that navigation and routing work as expected
